                    I have more than ten years of experience working as a salesperson in different segments, and now I'm in a new challenge: become software developer! I always have been close to tech; in some experiences, I sold smartphones, computers, and software to real estate industry. But now I'm excited to build solutions to facilitate people's life. I believe all my experience focused on customer experience added to my new programming skills, will help me to stand out in the tech industry.

                <h2>Banco do Brasil - April 2012 to July 2016</h2>
        
                <p>
                    Banco do Brasil was founded in 1808 and is the oldest active bank in Brazil. The bank is controlled by the Brazilian government, and since 2000 it is one of the four most-profitable Brazilian banks, holding a strong leadership position in retail banking. It was not easy to get this job because all employees are selected by a public examination, and it is competitive. After long months of study, I did my test, and I got the 22nd position in my city competing with more than 15 thousand people. Over these four years working there, I was able to build strong relationships with customers, offering the best bank solutions for their needs, and also I had been recognized for many times for sell performance.

                <h2>Dell Computers - February 2010 to November 2011</h2>
        
                <p>
                    Dell Computers dispense presentations, a big company in tech industry focused in customize computers according to customers' necessities. I started working in Consumer Team, and because of achieving great results, I started to work in Small Business Team. I performed sales of Dell's products and services, always focusing on customer experience. I was committed to achieving my goals, in many metrics I had performance above my team and excellent managers evaluations. Also, I had an outstanding performance in Oscar Top5 (that evaluates customer experience), I won a recognition trophy, and I was delegated to improve this result on my team. As a result, I identified points of improvement, worked on it suggesting better practices, and our rate improved.
